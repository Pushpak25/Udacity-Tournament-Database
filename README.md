# Udacity-Tournament-Database

# Getting Started

Vagrant virtual machine is required for this project which you can find here: https://github.com/udacity/fullstack-nanodegree-vm 
First, fork the fullstack-nanodegree-vm repository so that you have a version of your own within your Github account.
Next clone your fullstack-nanodegree-vm repo to your local machine.

# Understanding the purpose of each file
tournament.sql  - this file is used to set up your database schema (the table representation of your data structure).
tournament.py - this file is used to provide access to your database via a library of functions which can add, delete or query data in your database to another python program (a client program). Remember that when you define a function, it does not execute, it simply means the function is defined to run a specific set of instructions when called.
tournament_test.py - this is a client program which will use your functions written in the tournament.py module. We've written this client program to test your implementation of functions in tournament.py

# Functions Used
The various functions in tournament.py and their corresponding test functions in tournament_test.py are:

# Example of a 16 Player Swiss Tournament:
First round pairing is by random draw. For example, with 16 players they would be matched into 8 random pairs for the first round. For now, assume all games have a winner, and there are no draws.
After the first round, there will be a group of 8 players with a score of 1 (win), and a group of 8 players with a score of 0 (loss). For the 2nd round, players in each scoring group will be paired against each other – 1’s versus 1’s and 0’s versus 0’s.
After round 2, there will be three scoring groups:
4 players who have won both games and have 2 points
8 players who have won a game and lost a game and have 1 point
4 players who have lost both games and have no points.
Again, for round 3, players are paired with players in their scoring group. After the third round, the typical scoring groups will be:
2 players who have won 3 games (3 points)
6 players with 2 wins (2 points)
6 players with 1 win (1 point)
2 players with no wins (0 points)
For the fourth (and in this case final) round, the process repeats, and players are matched with others in their scoring group. Note that there are only 2 players who have won all of their games so far – they will be matched against each other for the "championship" game. After the final round, we’ll have something that looks like this:
1 player with 4 points – the winner!
4 players with 3 points – tied for second place
6 players with 2 points
4 players with 1 point
1 player with 0 points
The Swiss system produces a clear winner in just a few rounds, no-one is eliminated and almost everyone wins at least one game, but there are many ties to deal with.
